      "question": "What do you think of AMD vs CommonJS?",
      "type": "javascript",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "importance": "Low",
      "answer": "AMD and CommonJS are both Javascript module loader but works different. CommonJS is designed with server-side development in mind while AMD, with its support for asynchronous loading of modules, is more intended for browsers. CommonJS syntax is closer to Node.js style of writing/importing modules and there is less context-switching overhead when switching between client-side and server-side JavaScript development. CommonJS, is a standard, mostly used in servers and it loads modules synchronously, though extra step is required if you want your JS file size to be minified and compressed. AMD is better for browser, as it loads each distinct module in async manner instead of loading in one large file. No extra steps are required to use AMD, it works out-of-the-box. In my opinion, as it is its in Asynchronous nature, it makes alot of async http requests and may not be as performant as described by other devs."
